# Phase Pioneer

Next Up:
	
	Make neighbor tile calculations use "memory" neighbors for weaker values instead

Planned:
	
	Redraw map whenever radius value changes, trigger it internally instead of just on player move signal
	
	Make game end when map radius reaches 0
	
	Iframes for damage
	
	Elemental damage system
	
	Spawn location with no enemies
	
	UI
	
	Cleaner mapgen with nicer looking stuff
	
	Additional layer on tileset with decor
	
	High aberrance generates holes in map and other "weird" structures
	
	Minimap and pointers to points of interest
	
	Review mapgen to make sure no all floats are rounded to ints and not floored
	
	Cooler looking HP, Mana, Light bars - think Path of Exile
	
	Make Gamemaster variable updates emit signals instead of checking for them in process on other scripts
	
	Add encroaching shadows on map that either replace or complement light meter

Future Reference:
	
	Make different enemies behave differently in response to de-manifested hexes - some disappear with the hexes, some
	keep approaching through the nothingness, etc.
