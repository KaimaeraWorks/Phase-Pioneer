# Phase Pioneer

Next Up:
	
	

Planned:
	
	Iframes for damage
	
	Elemental damage system
	
	Spawn location with no enemies
	
	UI
	
	Cleaner mapgen with nicer looking stuff
	
	Additional layer on tileset with decor
	
	High aberrance generates holes in map and other "weird" structures
	
	Review mapgen to make sure no all floats are rounded to ints and not floored

Future Reference:
	
	Make different enemies behave differently in response to de-manifested hexes - some disappear with the hexes, some
	keep approaching through the nothingness, etc.
